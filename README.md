The Complete Train Management System (CTMS) is a software solution designed to automate key railway operations such as train scheduling, ticket booking, route management, and passenger services. 

----------------------Project proposal------------------------------
Introduction:
The Complete Train Management System (CTMS) is a software solution designed to automate key railway operations such as train scheduling, ticket booking, route management, and passenger services. It make easier job for both user and admin workflows, ensuring efficient, error-free, and accessible train service management. Built with  simple eye catching  design and practical coding principles, this project showcases real-world application of object-oriented programming and system logic. from booking tickets and checking train availability to managing routes and keeping everything running smoothly.
Objectives:
•	To provide a complete system for managing train operations including scheduling, ticket          booking, and route handling.
•	To help passengers easily search for trains, check availability, and book tickets through a user-friendly interface.
•	To allow administrators to manage train data, update schedules, and monitor bookings efficiently.
•	To automate manual tasks and reduce errors by using structured programming and logical workflows.
•	To apply object-oriented programming concepts like classes and modular design for clean and maintainable code.
•	To give user access to a user friendly all in one app for reducing time and money. 

Target customers: 
•	Railway Authorities and Administrators 
•	 passengers and Daily Commuters 
•	 Ticketing Agents and Booking Office 
•	Transport Planners and Analysts 
•	 Educational Institutions
•	 Developers and Tech Startups
Application features and Description:
Our goal is to make a complete train management system  (CTMS) for both user and the administrators of railway .
Here are the features of our application
•	Login: Administrators can securely log in to the system using their credentials. Can added , delete or modify train ticket and route and schedules. 
•	Dashboard: A user-friendly dashboard provides an overview of key information, such as train schedules, delays, and reservations.
•	Train Schedule by Station: Users can view train schedules for a specific station, including departure and arrival times.
•	Train Schedule by Destination: Users can search for train schedules based on their desired destination, making it easy to plan their journeys.
•	Train Delays: The system provides real-time updates on train delays, allowing administrators to manage and communicate delays effectively.
•	Train Cancellations: Users are informed about train cancellations promptly, enabling them to make alternate travel arrangements.
•	Ticket Reservation: Passengers can reserve tickets for their desired train and route, cancel and refund their ticket fare anytime in automated billing system. 
Tools and resources:
• 	C++ programming language for logic and object-oriented design.
• 	GCC / MinGW compiler to build and run the code.
• 	Visual Studio / VS Code as the development environment.
• 	C++ Standard Library for file handling and input/output operations.
• 	STL (Standard Template Library) for efficient data structures like vectors 
• 	Classes and objects to model trains, passengers, tickets, and routes.
• 	ASCII formatting and console UI enhancements for better user experience.
• 	Flowcharts and pseudocode for planning logic before coding.
• 	GitHub  for version control and project sharing among groups
Challenge:
Developing the system involved several technical and logical challenges. Structuring the code using OOP required careful planning to ensure simple and clarity. Managing complex data like train schedules, passenger details, and ticket records demanded efficient use of file handling and data structures. Creating a user-friendly console interface while handling edge cases like delays and cancellations added complexity. Debugging logical flaws and maintaining clean, readable code under performance needed further tested problem-solving skills throughout the project.
